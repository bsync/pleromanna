Pleroma Bible Church Source


This website is open source (just like the Gospel and the Bible). 
For software that just means that the technical details, of which there are many, are open to the public for review. 
Unlike the Bible this source code is flawed so use the GIT issues tab to submit issues against it for improvements.
