Just like the Gospel and the Bible this website is open source...
For software that just means that the technical details, of which there are many, are open to the public for review.
Unlike the Bible, Software is written by men and NOT Holy Spirit inspired. Therefore, software inherently has bugs.
Use the GIT issues tab to submit issues against it for improvements if/when you find it lacking.
